FitBook:

————————————

FitBook is an amalgam of ideas I had, a mixture between a clothing-inspiration sharing application, a rough buy-sell platform, and a playground for a bunch of other ideas.

The application starts with a Facebook authentication, in which users will register. The credentials that are allowed right now is bobmcmeans6@gmail.com, password is cs193p.

The app then launches into 4 tabs. 
The first tab allows you to look for items that are wanted for sale or wanted to buy, or just browse through pictures. The segmented tabs allow you to switch between different products (WTS is products for sale, WTB is products people want to buy, and explore shows all pictures). You can further refine your search with the filter button, and even from those search results if you want something specific you can use the search bar. Long pressing an image on these tabs will bring up a detail screen. If you click on the image on the detail screen, you “like” the image and there will is a like animation. From the detail screen you can see the details of the user, print the image, or see with the map button where the picture was posted.
The second tab allows you to upload pictures. You press select to pick a photo from your phone gallery. You cannot filter/upload/save without a picture in place. From there, you can press filter to apply a filter. You can apply multiple but only 1 at a time (so filter the picture, go back in the navigation bar, and then filter again). You can save the image to your photo gallery at any time. You can then specify a description, whether you want to sell/buy the piece, and any additional details using the buttons on the bottom. Then upload!
The third tab allows you to set a reminder for hot releases by different brands. Select a brand from the collection view at the top, set a date and a reminder message. 
The last tab is your profile and you can customize your bio by pressing on the label. The picture/name is pulled from facebook. The posts are all the posts you’ve made. In the settings you can logout reveal an easter egg which is a game (scroll to the bottom of settings way way down). 
If you hit the Ye button then you enter a game where you are kanye trying to collect shoes. There are some fake shoes however and if you hit those, you lose. You can restart the game or share your score whenever you die!

There are some functionalities of the app that I wanted to incorporate but couldn’t so there is some code irrelevant to the current functionality of the app.
